              Kajeede: Yaaawnnn ... I've been itching for a stretch.
              <br><br>
              Lorenzo: Well, lets sweep out all this water then we can venture outside.
              <br><br>
              Lakeesha: Nah fam... I wanna peep now.
              <br><br>

              Kajeede: _opens cellar doors. As light trickles in, the view is of a foreign land.
                       <br> There was nothing but one strongly rooted mahogany tree standing. 
                       <br>Anything that resembled a neighborhood was simply... gone. 
                       <br>It was as though all the concrete and steel evaporated.
                       <br> <br>
              Lakeesha: What on God's earth happened out here?!?<br> <br>
              -A few hours later-
              RADIO: zzZzzZzZz...Much worst...zZZzz...Stay indoors..break out...<br> <br>
              Lorenzo: Guy's ... This sounds really serious... 
                       <br>They're saying that there are rising cases of some disease at the hospitals and clinics. 
              <br> <br> 
              User: Might be from all the foreign gusts that assaulted us.
              <br> <br>
              Lakeesha: crap crap crap I should have stayed with my parents! The phones aren't working <br> and I need to know that they're okay.
              <br> <br>
              User:We'll be fine. They said to stay indoors so we will just do that until the curfew lifts. 
              <br> <br>
              Kajeede: indoors where? I can't stand this cramp up space any longer.
                        <br> we should go to the Complex to seek shelter and food you.
              <br> <br> 
              Lorenzo: If you think complex still up, you crazy.
              <br> <br>  
              Kajeede: Let's go people. we will seek refuge at the complex.
              <br> <br>
              Lakeesha: No... Let's scavenge around this neighborhood for canned goods!
