Ideas for SaveData feature in CSC420Project ---

Use levelkeys and username in order to keep track of progress 
Each level must have it's own levelkey 
Each level has a save option that goes to the "SaveFeature" servlet. 
*Currently researching online methods*
*AJAX, and Javascript are two ways of going about this*
*Will use Javascript*
Each level page will have hidden variables to keep GUI clean 

After hitting continue in the main menu ---- 
If in servlet using sql select statement, if a levelkey of 3 and a username is entered 
take the user to Game Page 3

If on Alternate Path, do the same ---- but instead with 3x 
thus taking the user to Game Page 3x
